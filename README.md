## Overview

The VTX-200 UI is a web-based dashboard for real-time monitoring, data logging, and control of the VTX-200 wind tunnel system.  
The web app is **pre-installed** on your wind tunnel hardware‚Äîno extra setup is needed.

---

## Accessing the Web App

1. Power on your VTX-200 wind tunnel controller.  
2. Connect to Wi-Fi:
   - **SSID:** `WindTunnel_AP`
   - **Password:** `12345678`
3. In a browser, open: `http://192.168.4.1`

---

## Dashboard Layout

- **Lift & Drag Card** ‚Äì Real-time wall/floor balance readings; toggle ‚ÄúWall/Floor‚Äù.
- **Pressure Card** ‚Äì Dynamic/static pressure (e.g., pitot).
- **Angle of Attack Card** ‚Äì Current AOA in degrees.
- **Wind Speed Card** ‚Äì Real-time airspeed (m/s).

---

## Controls

- **Start Recording** ‚Äì Begin logging sensor data.
- **Stop Recording** ‚Äì Stop logging.
- **Download CSV** ‚Äì Export recorded data for Excel/MATLAB/etc.
- **Zero Scales** ‚Äì Tare strain gauges with the model stationary.

**Command sent by UI:** `"tare"` when ‚ÄúZero Scales‚Äù is clicked.

---

## Interpreting Data

- **Lift/Drag** ‚Äì grams (g) or Newtons (N) (device-configured).  
- **Pressure** ‚Äì From tunnel sensors.  
- **AOA** ‚Äì Degrees (¬∞).  
- **Wind Speed** ‚Äì m/s.

---

## Best Practices

- Always zero (tare) the strain gauges before starting a test.
- Wait for readings to stabilize before recording data.
- Download your CSV file after each recording session.

## Troubleshooting

- **Web app doesn‚Äôt load:**  
    - Make sure you are connected to `WindTunnel_AP` WiFi.
    - Ensure the controller is powered on.
    - Try refreshing your browser or a different device.
- **No live data:**  
    - Check that all hardware and sensors are properly connected.
    - Try zeroing the scales if readings are stuck.
