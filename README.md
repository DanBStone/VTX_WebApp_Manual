This repository is the **official instruction manual** for the VTX-200 Wind Tunnel Web App, developed by **Simteq Engineering**.  
> **Note:** This repository contains **documentation only**. The VTX-200 UI software is proprietary and distributed with authorized hardware.

## Overview

The VTX-200 UI is a web-based dashboard for real-time monitoring, data logging, and control of the VTX-200 wind tunnel system.  
The web app is **pre-installed** on your wind tunnel hardware—no extra setup is needed.

---

## Accessing the Web App

1. Power on your VTX-200 wind tunnel controller.  
2. Connect to Wi-Fi:
   - **SSID:** `WindTunnel_AP`
   - **Password:** `12345678`
3. In a browser, open: `http://192.168.4.1`

---

## Dashboard Layout

- **Lift & Drag Card** – Real-time wall/floor balance readings; toggle “Wall/Floor”.
- **Pressure Card** – Dynamic/static pressure (e.g., pitot).
- **Angle of Attack Card** – Current AOA in degrees.
- **Wind Speed Card** – Real-time airspeed (m/s).

---

## Controls

- **Start Recording** – Begin logging sensor data.
- **Stop Recording** – Stop logging.
- **Download CSV** – Export recorded data for Excel/MATLAB/etc.
- **Zero Scales** – Tare strain gauges with the model stationary.

**Command sent by UI:** `"tare"` when “Zero Scales” is clicked.

---

## Interpreting Data

- **Lift/Drag** – grams (g) or Newtons (N) (device-configured).  
- **Pressure** – From tunnel sensors.  
- **AOA** – Degrees (°).  
- **Wind Speed** – m/s.

---

## Best Practices

- Always zero (tare) the strain gauges before starting a test.
- Wait for readings to stabilize before recording data.
- Download your CSV file after each recording session.

## Troubleshooting

- **Web app doesn’t load:**  
    - Make sure you are connected to `WindTunnel_AP` WiFi.
    - Ensure the controller is powered on.
    - Try refreshing your browser or a different device.
- **No live data:**  
    - Check that all hardware and sensors are properly connected.
    - Try zeroing the scales if readings are stuck.
